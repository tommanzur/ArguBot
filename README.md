# ArguBot: Chatbot for Sociotechnical Argument Analysis

ArguBot is a unique chatbot based on the doctoral thesis "Construction of Arguments and Socio-Technical Controversies" by Tomás Manzur. It offers interactive access to the thesis's insights on the Plan Provincial de Ordenamiento Territorial of Mendoza.

ArguBot is a chatbot designed to explore and facilitate understanding of the complexities presented in the thesis. It allows users to interact with the contents of the research, providing access to detailed information and analysis of the arguments and socio-technical controversies linked to the PPOT.

ArguBot, a chatbot created as part of Tomás Manzur's doctoral thesis, is an advanced and specialized tool. It incorporates state-of-the-art technologies and methodologies in artificial intelligence and natural language processing. Key features include:

- **Embedding Model**: ArguBot utilizes sophisticated embedding models. These models transform textual input into numerical vectors, capturing semantic meanings and contextual nuances. This feature is crucial for understanding and processing user queries effectively.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: ArguBot employs the RAG model, which combines the benefits of retrieval-based and generative models. This approach allows the chatbot to retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base (like the thesis content) and then generate coherent, contextually appropriate responses. This method is particularly effective in handling complex queries related to the thesis's themes and arguments.
- **Customization for Thesis Content**: The chatbot is specifically tailored to engage with the content of the thesis. This includes understanding and navigating the intricacies of territorial planning, socio-technical controversies, and argumentation analysis related to the Mendoza Territorial Planning Plan.
- **User Privacy and Data Security**: In its design and implementation, special attention is paid to user privacy and data security, ensuring that interactions with ArguBot are confidential and secure.
